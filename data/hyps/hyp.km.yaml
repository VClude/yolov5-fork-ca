momentum: 0.937    # SGD momentum/Adam beta1
weight_decay: 0.0005 # Optimizer weight decay
warmup_epochs: 3.0 # Warmup epochs
warmup_momentum: 0.8 # warmup initial momentum
warmup_bias_lr: 0.1 # warmup initial bias lr

# Loss Gains (BALANCED MODIFICATIONS FOR SMALL OBJECTS)
box: 0.05          # Box loss gain (Keep standard)
cls: 1.5           # <--- REDUCED from 3.0 (was too aggressive)
cls_pw: 1.0        # cls BCELoss positive_weight
obj: 0.7           # <--- INCREASED from 0.5 (was too low)
obj_pw: 1.0        # obj BCELoss positive_weight
iou_t: 0.20        # <--- INCREASED from 0.15 (more stable)
